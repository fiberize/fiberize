/**
 * @defgroup io_modes IO modes
 * @ingroup io
 *
 * Controls how to execute IO operations.
 *
 * IO modes control whether an IO operation should be blocking, asynchronous or nonblocking.
 * There are three IO modes:
 *   - Await - Executing an IO operation in await mode will block the fiber until the operation is done,
 *             while processing messages and allowing other fibers to execute. This mode is usually the default.
 *   - Block - Exeuting an IO operation in block mode will block the fiber and the thread it is executing on.
 *             This version does not process messages and does not allow other fibers to execute on this core.
 *   - Async - Executing an IO operation in defer mode won't block the fiber and won't process messages.
 *             Instead it starts the IO operation asynchronously and reports the result with an event.
 *
 * IO operations are implemented as template functions, which take the mode as a template parameter.
 * For example we can open a file in three different ways:
 * * Blocking:
 *   @code
 *     File file = File::open<Block>("test", O_RDONLY, 0777);
 *   @endcode
 * * Nonblocking, but synchronous:
 *   @code
 *     File file = File::open<Await>("test", O_RDONLY, 0777);
 *   @endcode
 * * Asynchronous, which gives us an Event with the value wrapped in a Result:
 *   @code
 *     Event<Result<File>> event = File::open<Async>("test", O_RDONLY, 0777);
 *     File file = event.await().get();
 *   @endcode
 *
 * Most functions provide a default mode. For example if you call
 * @code
 *   File file = File::open("test", O_RDONLY, 0777);
 * @endcode
 * it will use the Block mode.
