/**
 * @defgroup lifecycle Schedulers and lifecycle of a task
 *
 * Each of the four task types (fiber, actor, future, thread) follows the same lifycycle, with minor variations.
 *
 * Tasks are executed by schedulers. There are two types of schedulers:
 *  - Singletask scheduler, which executes only a single fiber, from start to finish.
 *  - Multitask scheduler, which switches between fibers and balances its work queue with other multitask schedulers.
 * A task can be pinned, which means that it can only be run by a particular scheduler. If a task is not pinned,
 * it can be migrated between schedulers freely.
 *
 * When you create a task, it starts in the state Starting and gets passed to a scheduler. Once a scheduler picks up a newly
 * created task it changes its status to Running and executes the function associated with the task. In the case of fibers,
 * threads and futures after the function finishes the task's state is changed to Dead, it's closure is destroyed and it
 * doesn't get rescheduled any more.
 *
 * The situation is different with actors: after an actor's function finishes, it enters the Listening state, during which
 * it keeps processing incoming events. Each time an event arrives the actor's state is temporarily changed to Running
 * and after the event is processed the actor goes back to Listening. The process goes on until the actor requests to be
 * terminated, or throws an unhandled exception, which changes the state to Dead.
 *
 * If any task or an actor in the Listening mode processing an event blocks or yields, it will become Suspended. Once some condition
 * is satisfied (or instantly in the case of yield()) it will be rescheduled and when a scheduler picks up the task it will be
 * resumed.
 *
