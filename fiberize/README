Fiberize is a C++ framework for parallel (and in the future distributed) computing. It implements
an M:N threading model, where the basic unit of parallelism is a very light thread, called a fiber.
A large number of fibers is executed on a small number of OS threads, usually equal to the number
of physical cores.

Fibers in fiberize can communicate by sending and receiving events. When a fiber waits for an
event it doesn't block the OS thread it was running on - instead the execution switches to
another fiber. This means that you can write asynchronous and nonblocking code as easly as you
would write a synchronous version.
